## Handing In Finally 
- I know I am late but thankfully I put in enough effort here on this that I think I learned quite a lot. It turns out i went way too deep in trying to understand 3rd party api's when we havent really gone much inot them. I really overwhelmed myself and definitely struggled so late at night trying to figure out even simple things at that point.
